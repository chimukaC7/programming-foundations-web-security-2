-Data theft 		-Loss of access
-Spying  			-Loss of control


- Let's talk about why security's important. It's easy to set up a basic website. You write a bit of HTML, add a bit of CSS, sign up for a hosting plan and viola, you've got a website. And with a simple website there aren't many security problems. Users interact with the site by typing a URL, or by clicking links, and the pages they see are the same every time. This might give you the impression that new features and technologies can be added to simple HTML pages just as easily. Over time perhaps you decide to add some JavaScript, use PHP to create dynamic pages, store data in cookies, or connect to a backend database. However, it's important to recognize that as a site incorporates new features it increases in complexity and gains security issues. The new features may introduce the ability to perform actions that you don't expect. In fact hackers scan the internet looking for web servers that are set up by beginners, or that use technologies or configurations that they can exploit. They don't need to be at their keyboard or decide to target you specifically, they write code that does the scanning and the hacking for them. A hacker is able to exploit a weakness, may be able to make changes to your website, to steal data or to take complete control over the server. Potential consequences for failing to secure a website include monetary theft, identity theft, data theft, spying, spam, embarrassment, loss of access or loss of control. Loss of control may seem less significant than theft and spying, but I think it's the most consequential. Your website could be used for purposes that you don't intend. It might be used to harm visitors to your site. It might be used to attack or exploit other servers. These consequences can have real world cost to the owner or to users of a website. Monetary theft has obvious cost to a company and its customers. Data theft may have a direct cost if the data is valuable or can be sold, and it can have an indirect cost by reducing trust. A web server sending out spam email can cause legitimate emails to be flagged to spam. Something as simple as defacing a webpage can embarrass a company and hurt their brand. So as you can see, security's not optional. It can't be an afterthought. Security is an essential skill for all web developers.
