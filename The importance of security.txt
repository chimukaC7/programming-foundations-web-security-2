The importance of security
- Security is essential for all web developers to learn. If you're building websites of any kind, you need it. It's not an optional feature like learning a new JavaScript framework. Online threats are real, and consequences for ignoring them can be serious. Security cannot be an afterthought. It has to be considered from the early stages of project planning to the launch of a website and beyond. Without a firm grounding, it can be easy to make mistakes that leave you vulnerable. In this course, we'll learn the fundamentals of web security to give you that grounding. We're going to learn about security by getting an understanding of the general principles which guide all security work, and then we'll get more specific by looking at best practices to prevent vulnerabilities and the most common attacks, so that you know how to protect your website from them.
